# MScGraduationProject
Models and data analysis scripts used for my graduation project in MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis 

Goal: find a robust policy for food distribution in refugee settlements given the mix of behaviour of refugees when queuing 

Process:
1. Developed a queuing model (see Model_Queuing_4122021)
2. Coupled the model with the work done by Bogel (see Model_Coupled_withoutplots_4122021 for coupled model)
3. Run experiments  (to be added)
4. Analyse results  (to be added)


There are also three supportive flowcharts in the repository:
1. Flowchart_Queuing - shows the logic behind the queuing model
2. Flowchart_ActivitiesBogel - shows the logic behind the activities in Bogel's model
3. Flowchart_Coupling - shows the coupling process (at a very high level)
